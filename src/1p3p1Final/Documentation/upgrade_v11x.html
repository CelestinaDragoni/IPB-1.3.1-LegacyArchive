  <b>Synopsis: Upgrading from v1.1.x to v1.2</b>

  <br>

  To upgrade your existing board from Invision Board v1.1.x to Invision Board v1.2, you'll need to update all the program files and

  run an upgrade script that is included in this distribution. You may want to create a database back up and download via FTP any

  existing language packs and skin files as these may be over-written during the upgrade.

  <br><br>

  <b>Important: Skins and full text searching</b>

  <br>

  All v1.1.x skins are not compatible with v1.2. IPB v1.2 has an XHTML compliant skin which has been totally rewritten. The upgrade

  process will 'sunset' all your current skins by marking them as hidden so that you may manually update them if desired.

  <br /><br />

  IPB v1.2 also supports full text searching. It is recommended that after the upgrade you log into your Admin CP, expand the "Board Options" sub menu and

  set up full text search. Note, you will not be able to use the "quick" search until full text searching has been enabled.

  <b>Saving Old Data</b>

  <br>

  If you wish to save the information in the old default skin, please do the following:

  <br>

  <span style='color:blue'>Via FTP download the directories "Skin/s1/" and "style_images/1/"</span>. The upgrade will need the

  v1.1 files to reside in those directories and any previous data will be lost. You will also need to export the default macro set if

  you wish to retain the information. This <em>should</em> just be the original v1.1 macro set and overwriting it will be harmless.

  <br><br>

  <b>Uploading the Files</b>

  <br>

  From the unzipped package, upload the following files to the same directory that your existing board is in:

  <br><span style='color:blue'>admin.php

    <br>css.php

	<br>index.php

	<br>install_templates.txt

	<br>show.php

	<br>upgrade5.php</span>

	<br><br>Upload the directories (and any contents / sub directories):

	<br>

	<span style='color:red'>

	cache

	<br>

	fonts

	<br>

	html (All files and sub forums, etc)

	<br>

	lang/en/*.php  (All PHP files. Create the directory if it's not there and upload into it)

	<br>

	Skin/s1/*.php (All PHP files. Create the directory if it's not there and upload into it)

	<br>

	sources/*.*  (All PHP files and sub folders)

	<br>

	style_images/1/ (All files. Create the directory "1" if it's not there and upload into it)</span>

	<br><br>

	In short: Upload everything as if it were a new install!

	<br><br>

	<b>Please check the following before you proceed</b>

	<br>You MUST ensure that the new skin PHP files are in a directory called "Skin/s1/" - if you have previously removed "s1" from the "Skins" directory, please re-create it via FTP and upload the skin PHP files into it.

	<br><br>You MUST ensure that the new images are in a directory called "style_images/1/" - if you have previously

	removed "1" from the "style_images" directory, please re-create it via FTP and upload the images into it.

	<br><br>You MUST make sure the file 'install_templates.txt' is uploaded into the same directory as 'index.php'

	<br><br>You MUST make sure the script 'upgrade5.php' is uploaded into the same directory as 'index.php'

	<br><br>

	<b>Running the upgrade script</b>

	<br>

	Open up a new browser window and enter the URL to the upgrade5.php script (example: www.board.com/forums/upgrade5.php)

	Follow the onscreen instructions to update your database.

	<br><br>

	If you get an error during the upgrade, try hitting back in your browser and try again.

	<br>

	This script will upgrade your database, install new templates and perform a clean up.

	<br><br>

	<span style='color:red'><b>IMPORTANT: PLEASE REMOVE THE SCRIPT WHEN THE UPGRADE IS COMPLETED!</b></span>

	<br><br>

	That's it, you should be done!

  <b>The upgrade worked fine, but I get a blank screen now!!</b>

  <br>

  The upgrade takes it's best guess when it creates the new skin set, it's not impossible that it might not match everything up.

  If you get a blank screen, it's usually because the board wrapper it's chosen is broken / doesn't exist. Try the following:

  <br>Log into your Admin CP. Go to "Skins & Templates". Click on "Manage Skin Sets" and edit "IPB Default Set (1.2)" and make

  sure it's got a valid template set and wrapper.

  <br><br>

  <b>I can't do anything, I get loads of errors!!</b>

  <br>

  This is <b>always</b> caused by a failure to update the files in "Skin/s1/" on your server. Simply put, they MUST be updated from

  the ones included in this zip file (upload/Skins/s1). Upload the skins and refresh your browser.
